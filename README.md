## INTRODUCTION ðŸ”‹

Power outages in the United States are a prime example of a common occurance that has a lots of *slight* variation over a population. For example, it is commonly believed that power outages vary in intensity and duration due to:


- Temperature of locale
- Local power demand
- Humidity and presence of storms
- Natural disasters
- Even (sadly) animals



And of thanks to all of these variables, no two outages will ever quite be the same.

But just because every outage is different, it doesn't mean we can't find common threads or patterns that tell us valuable information about such a trend.

Thanks to **Purdue University's LASCI (Laboratory For Advancing Sustainable Critical Infrastructure)**,Â¹ we have access to **1534 rows** of power outage data that contain valuable column informationÂ² like:

<br />

- **OUTAGE.DURATION**:
>"Duration of outage event (in minutes)." This is one of the most stark characteristics of a power outage.
<br />

- **POSTAL.CODE**
>"Represents the postal code of the U.S. states." Useful as an abbreviation or indicator for individual states.
<br />

- **CUSTOMERS.AFFECTED**
>"Number of customers affected by the power outage event." Gives perspective on size or magnitude of the outage.

<br />
<br />
<br />
With these data in mind, we believe an interesting question that naturally arises is:

<br />
<br />

> #### Every state has power outages from time to time, but which states' outages appear to be unusually long?

<br />

The key word here is "unusually." Sure, an outage may be long from time to time, but when is that length *statistically significant* or *unusual*? We find that addressing such a question has room for comparison to multiple variables and drawing unique parallels. Eventually, we might be able to reason or speculate as to *why* our offender states end up having these longer outages.
